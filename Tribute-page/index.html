            <blockquote>

                <p>"I am one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life. My very first political action
                    , the first thing I ever did that involved an issue, or a policy, or politics, was a protest against apartheid.
                    I would study his words and his writings. The day he was released from prison gave me a sense of what human beings
                    can do when they're guided by their hopes and not by their fears."</p>
